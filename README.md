Geoscience computing workflow using Python with dataset in Google Drive cloud database

**Please open the Public geoscience data** ðŸ‘‰ [![Data repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/data%20available-google%20drive-green)](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/0B7brcf-eGK8CRUhfRW9rSG91bW8)

This Google Drive database comprises of public geoscience data compiled by [@peter Ba](peteramstrand@gmail.com). Contents as follows:
* 48 well composite logs
* Canning 3D TDQ seismic
* Dutch F3 seismic data
* GEOLINK North Sea wells
* Poseidon seismic
* Core images

## How to access the public geoscience data?

Follow these steps:
1. Open the Google Drive link above, or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/0B7brcf-eGK8CRUhfRW9rSG91bW8)
2. Once you open the drive, the folder `Public geoscience Data` will be stored in your `Shared with Me`.
3. Move the folder `Public geoscience Data` into your `My Drive`. Just drag and drop. Follow the GIF tutorial below if you feel lost how to do this action ðŸ™‚

4. Once the `Public geoscience Data` moved to your `My Drive`, you could then access it. To access the data, we will use Google Colaboratory! Google Colab will be used for the entire geoscience computation in this repo.
5. A tutorial notebook consists of workflow to access the data is provided. Visit [this notebook](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/open-geoscience-repository/blob/master/how_to_access_public_geoscience_data.ipynb)

After this, we will do lots of geoscience computation with this open dataset! 

## Workflows with Python
* Well log visualization and analysis (BIG DATA)
* Read seismic data
* Colored seismic inversion
* Machine learning!
