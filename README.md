# Open Geoscience Computing Repository

> Geoscience computing workflow using Python with dataset in online and Google Drive databases.

üëá This is a quick catalogue of the open databases! Click on the associated link of each database to read the further details, including more detailed explanations (step-by-step) on the Python workflow to access the data.

Let's get started!

### ‚ùì Why do we need Google Colaboratory?

For Python users, we have already been familiar with the **Jupyter notebooks** on a local computer. While geoscience datasets often comes into a very **large size** (megabytes, gigabytes), we don't want to populate our computer with large datasets. The right choice, is to access the datasets and compute **on cloud**.

Yes, **Google Colaboratory is a Jupyter notebook in the Google cloud** (Note: not a Google Cloud Platform). Why Google Colab? Well, first and foremost, Google Colab is free. Second, we can speed up the download rate of a large dataset. 

On top of every how-to-access tutorial notebooks link, there will be a badge like this ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg). **<ins>Click this badge</ins>**, and we will be re-directed to Google Colab to run the codes. 

# Google Drive *Public geoscience Data*

This Google Drive database comprises of public geoscience data compiled by [@peter Ba](peteramstrand@gmail.com). Contents as follows:
* Canning 3D TDQ seismic
* Dutch F3 seismic data
* GEOLINK North Sea wells
* Poseidon seismic
* Core images
* 48 well composite logs

### How to access these data?

Follow these steps:
1. Open this link üëâ [![Data repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/data%20available-google%20drive-green)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B7brcf-eGK8CRUhfRW9rSG91bW8)
2. Once you open the drive, the folder `Public geoscience Data` will be stored in your `Shared with Me`.
3. Move the folder `Public geoscience Data` into your `My Drive`. Just drag and drop. Follow the GIF tutorial below if you feel lost how to do this action üôÇ

</div>

4. Once the `Public geoscience Data` moved to your `My Drive`, you could then access it. To access the data, we will use Google Colaboratory! Google Colab will be used for the entire geoscience computation in this repo.
5. A tutorial notebook consists of workflow to access the data (from **extracting ZIP or TAR files** to **viewing simple data e.g. seismic data and well log data**) is provided.

# SEG Wiki Open Data

The website SEG Wiki, please go through the [page](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Open_data) to see the lists of the open data. There are almost > 30 major datasets (well logs, 2D and 3D seismic both the original data from major fields and synthetic data, synthetic earth model, gravity and magnetic data, etc) overall, <ins>however</ins> some data contains unrecognizable formats that could not be processed simply in Python. Here are some of the contents that are accessible so far:

* Poland 2D Vibroseis Line
* Stratton 3D
* Mobil Avo Viking Graben Line 12

> Note: These lists will be updated frequently whenever I find certain dataset could be accessed using Python!

### How to access these data?

First off, it is best if we know any detail about the dataset. So, please visit first the SEG Wiki [page](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Open_data), and browse the name of the dataset.

Next, directly visit this tutorial [notebook]() link, click on the badge ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) that appeared on top, and you will be re-directed to Google Colab. We will learn how to use `wget` to get the data directly from the open database website, just follow through the instructions!
